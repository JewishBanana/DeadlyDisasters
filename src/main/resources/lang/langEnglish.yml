tips:
    acidstorm: 'Tip: Seek immediate shelter to avoid the acid rain. Metal items and armor melt incredibly fast in the rain.'
    plague: 'Tip: Avoid making contact with any mobs, if you see black particles near a mob it means they are infected.'

    cavein: 'Tip: Avoid cramped caves with low roofs.'
    earthquake: 'Tip: Sneaking can really help during these. Also try boxing yourself in.'

    sinkhole: 'Tip: The ground around you becomes unstable, try placing blocks below you to stop falling.'
    solarstorm: 'Tip: Watch out, standing near heat sources can ignite you! During solarstorms all burning last twice as long.'
    soulstorm: 'Tip: Lost souls can travel through walls so shelter wont help you..'
    supernova: 'Tip: Run.'
    tornado: 'Tip: Always carry a water bucket with you.'
