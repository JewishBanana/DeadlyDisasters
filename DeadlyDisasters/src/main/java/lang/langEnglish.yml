tips:
    acidstorm: 'Tip: Seek immediate shelter to avoid the acid rain. Metal items and armor melt incredibly fast in the rain.'
    plague: 'Tip: Avoid making contact with any mobs, if you see black particles near a mob it means they are infected.'
    blizzard: 'Tip: Blizzards only affect those in cold biomes. Wear leather armor to nullify the freezing, standing close to strong heat sources also nullifies the freezing.'
    cavein: 'Tip: Avoid cramped caves with low roofs.'
    earthquake: 'Tip: Sneaking can really help during these. Also try boxing yourself in.'
    endstorm: 'Tip: Hiding does not work during these storms. Try to slay void mobs as they appear from rifts to avoid crowding.'
    extremewinds: 'Tip: Strong winds do not affect you inside small buildings, just watch out for the walls being torn.'
    geyser: 'Tip: Geysers appear deep underground, the higher you are the longer it takes for them to reach you.'
    hurricane: 'Tip: Try going underground as fast as possible. Hurricanes only appear in tropical biomes or oceans.'
    meteorshowers: 'Tip: Meteors land on the surface and cant penetrate many blocks, try going underground.'
    purge: 'Tip: Try getting to high ground where most mobs cant reach. Beware of Tunnellers..'
    sandstorm: 'Tip: Sandstorms only affect those in desert biomes. If you get caught in one, dont stop running..'
    sinkhole: 'Tip: The ground around you becomes unstable, try placing blocks below you to stop falling.'
    solarstorm: 'Tip: Watch out, standing near heat sources can ignite you! During solarstorms all burning last twice as long.'
    soulstorm: 'Tip: Lost souls can travel through walls so shelter wont help you..'
    supernova: 'Tip: Run.'
    tornado: 'Tip: Always carry a water bucket with you.'
    tsunami: 'Tip: Tsunamis only happen near deep water. Do not get caught up in these.'
    monsoon: 'Tip: Monsoons have such heavy rainfall that mobs cannot even breathe, as the water level rises drowned leave the ocean.'
    infestedcaves: 'Tip: Avoid breaking the infestation, it regenerates and might let it know where you are...'
